However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation.

Jane Street has spent decades developing their own trading models and machine learning solutions to identify profitable opportunities and quickly decide whether to execute trades.
